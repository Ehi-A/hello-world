Hello lol
My name is Ehi (ayy-hee) and im a undergraduate at THE University of Chapel Hill. Im fairly new to the coding world and have so much to learn but im interested. I have aspirations to either work in IT, be a developer, or work with cyber security.
Im looking for projects i can work on that i can put to the side in order to beef up my resueme.
